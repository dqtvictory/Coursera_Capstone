    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Paris, France is where I live. This city is remarkably dynamic and diversified with lots of ethnic groups as well as religions and income classes. With millions of habitants within the city, plus over 3 times more of that in the suburbs, health care is one of the most important services in people's everyday life. France is the nation with top-notched health care system providing low-cost service of very high quality to its vast majority of population, where the Social Security takes care of 70% of nearly all medical-related fees, therefore health care is almost available to everybody.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the popularity of public health care, it is sometimes not very easy to get a next-day appointment with the doctor, or have one's wisdom tooth extracted within the week when it starts to cause pain. Hospitals can sometimes be filled with patients from all working classes that wealthier patients may desire more privacy they don't have. Thus, private medical service providers can tailor to the needs of these patients, by supplying beds and chambers with greater privacy and utilities, better meals and personal services, access to top-of-the-line equipments and medicine, and so on. It's worth noting that the national Social Security only pays for 70% of ***conventionned*** medical-related fees, meaning for example a doctor's consultation is conventionned at 23.00 euros, therefore one is reimbursed _23.00 * 0.7 = 16.10_ for each consultation. Of course this leaves 6.90 euros left to be paid for the conventionned price, plus more if the doctor sets his or her price higher.\n",

    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to explore the city of Paris, the capital of France, and its neighborhoods to find the best location(s) to start a business in providing high-end medical services. In other words, I would like to open a private clinic in Paris for patients with high income, where should I look in Paris?\n",
